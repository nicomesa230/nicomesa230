# I'm Nico Mesa

Iâ€™m a junior **backend developer** currently working at **Eco Clic**, specialized in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white), ![Odoo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Odoo-714B67?style=flat&logo=odoo&logoColor=white) and ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?style=flat&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white).

Iâ€™m passionate about improving the **user experience** in business tools, optimizing workflows through practical and modern solutions.  

On a daily basis, I work with **Python (Odoo)** as backend, building ERP solutions with the Eco Clic team, including **automations, custom software, and exposing API endpoints** for frontend developers.  

Here youâ€™ll find both professional and personal projects, where I apply what I learn and explore new ideas. Iâ€™m constantly striving to learn, grow, and prove what Iâ€™m capable of.
